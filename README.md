# Barista Helper

Currently in progress...

Barista Helper is a web application that helps store coffee recipes and walks through them with a built in timer. Users will be able to add, edit and delete recipes and will be able to pick from 3 different brew methods at this time (French Press, Espresso, and Aeropress). The insipiration of this app stemmed from my interest in coffee and always having notes on different recipes and having to set timers for each step.
